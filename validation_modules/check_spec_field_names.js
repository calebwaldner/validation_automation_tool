// The goal of this module is to provide the user with a list of field names from the spec and database that should be reviewed due to problems with matching.




// Get spec and db json
// For each spec field name
  // Find a match in the db
    // If match is found
      // Spec field name is flaged as passing
      // db field name is flagged as passing
    // If no match, push spec field to results arr
// log results arr with spec field names.
// log the db fields that never got a passing
